        <p>My name is Wilson Cardichon, and this is my first course in website programming.
            I
            expect to learn the fundamentals of how websites are built, including HTML, CSS,
            and
            basic
            programming concepts. I hope this course will help me develop practical skills
            to
            create simple, functional
            websites and better understand how web technologies work. I am also looking
            forward
            to gaining
            confidence in coding and applying these skills in future academic and
            professional
            projects.

        <p> Champ de Mars is the main public square in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and a central symbol
            of the nation’s history and civic life. Located in downtown Port-au-Prince, it has long
            been a
            place for national celebrations, public gatherings, protests, and cultural events. It is
            surrounded by important landmarks such as monuments to Haiti’s independence leaders and
            the National
            Pantheon Museum (MUPANAH). It reflects both Haiti’s revolutionary heritage and everyday
            urban
            life.
